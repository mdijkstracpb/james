Description: James is your servant in the archive who automates the trivial parts of your analysis so you have more time for the smart work. James works as follows. For each of your projects James allocates a separate room in the archive. A given project may study different scenarios. James stores all data of a given scenario in a particular closet. Each drawer in the closet corresponds to a different data type. A data set of a given type may have different versions. James stores each version in a separate folder and puts the folders in the right drawer. The folder in the front is the version you work with. Because James is context aware, you can get/put your data with minimal effort. James automatically and transparently stores your data on disk.
